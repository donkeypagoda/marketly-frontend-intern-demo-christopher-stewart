## This repo was created to fulfill the following code challenge for Marketly:

## Front-end Engineering Intern Demo Project
Use the “Recipe Puppy” API to create a meal planning application. The application will allow a fictional catering company to create a complete meal for their customers, allowing them to search for a dish, view a list of results, select a dish and add it to a meal. An example breakfast meal would include three dishes: fruit, oatmeal, eggs. A meal is displayed as a series of dishes showing a list of titles, ingredients, link, and an optional photo.

Please do not spend more than 4 to 5 hours on this project. Completeness is not as important as demonstrating quality, knowledge, and skill.
Primary Features

    Search box that will query API.
    Display list of search results as title, ingredients, link, and photo.
    Apply CSS styles to result items.

## Secondary Features (time permitting)

    Add a dish from search results to a meal.
    Display meals as a list of dishes.
    Ability to remove a dish from a meal.

## Resources

    Create a new repository on Github.com to which to upload your source.
    Access Recipe Puppy API documentation here: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/
    Use any front-end framework you like. No back-end server should be necessary except as a file server. You can use a builder to bootstrap application:
        React's create-react-app https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
        Angular CLI https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
        Ember CLI https://ember-cli.com/
        Vue CLI https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli
        Others are fine if you are proficient.
    CSS Frameworks: It is preferred that you do not use a framework. Focus more on functionality, use native HTML tags, and apply minimal CSS where necessary.
